              In the ever-evolving world of digital product design,
              collaboration between designers and developers has always been a
              crucial‚Äîyet often challenging‚Äîpart of <br /> the process. In April
              2025, Figma introduced Dev Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at
              streamlining that collaboration more than ever before.

            <b>üîß What Is Dev Mode?</b>
            <p>
              Dev Mode is a new interface within Figma that provides
              developer-focused tools and removes unnecessary UI clutter that
              designers typically use. Instead,
              <br /> developers can view ready-to-implement specs, such as
              spacing, color values, font styles, and asset exports‚Äîwithout
              disrupting the design file or asking the <br /> design team for
              clarifications.

              Traditionally, handing off designs involved back-and-forth
              communication, misunderstandings, and occasional delays. With Dev

              <li>
                Live Design Specs: Developers can inspect the design without

              </li>
              <li>
                Code Snippets: Automatically generated CSS, iOS (Swift), and

              <li>

            <p>
              For design teams working in agile environments, the speed of
              handoff can make or break a sprint. Figma‚Äôs Dev Mode turns a
              typically messy phase into a <br /> collaborative, real-time
              experience that reduces errors, shortens build times, and improves
              the designer-developer relationship.
