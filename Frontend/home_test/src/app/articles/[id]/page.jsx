            In the ever-evolving world of digital product design, collaboration
            between designers and developers has always been a crucial‚Äîyet often
            challenging‚Äîpart of the process. In April 2025, Figma introduced Dev
            Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at streamlining that
            collaboration more than ever before.

          <h2 className="font-bold mb-2">üîß What Is Dev Mode?</h2>
          <p>
            Dev Mode is a new interface within Figma that provides
            developer-focused tools and removes unnecessary UI clutter that
            designers typically use. Instead, developers can view
            ready-to-implement specs‚Äîsuch as spacing, color values, font styles,
            and asset exports‚Äîwithout disrupting the design file or asking the
            design team for clarifications.

            Traditionally, handing off designs involved back-and-forth

            <li>
              Live Design Specs: Developers can inspect the design without

            <li>
              Code Snippets: Automatically generated CSS, iOS (Swift), and
